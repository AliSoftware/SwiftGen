# SwiftGen CHANGELOG

---

## 0.4.3

* Updated for Xcode 7 Beta 6 [[@Dimentar](https://github.com/Dimentar), [#14](https://github.com/AliSoftware/SwiftGen/pull/14)]

## 0.4.2

* Added `import Foundation` on top of `swiftgen-l10n` generated code [[@Nick11](https://github.com/Nick11), [#12](https://github.com/AliSoftware/SwiftGen/pull/12)]

## 0.4.1

* Updated for Xcode 7 Beta 5
* `swiftgen-storyboard` now allows to take a path to a `.storyboard` file as argument (as an alternative to give a path to a whole directory)
* The `-v` and `--version` flags are now recognized and print the executable version.

## 0.4.0

* Reorganized files into an **Xcode project** with one target per executable [[#2](https://github.com/AliSoftware/SwiftGen/issues/2)]
* Added **Unit Tests** (one per executable + one for common code) [[#2](https://github.com/AliSoftware/SwiftGen/issues/2)]
* Improved `SwiftGen-L10n` parsing of format strings and placeholders. [[#4](https://github.com/AliSoftware/SwiftGen/issues/4), [#5](https://github.com/AliSoftware/SwiftGen/issues/5), [#6](https://github.com/AliSoftware/SwiftGen/issues/6)]
* Updated `Rakefile` so that it now invokes `xcodebuild install`. You can now easily build & install all `swiftgen-xxx` executables in `/usr/local/bin` or anywhere else.
* Added a **version** string (date + sha1) to the built executables (displayed when invoked with no argument)

## 0.3.0

* Reducted the default code generated by `SwiftGenColorEnumBuilder` to avoid clobbering the `UIColor` namespace
* Changed the "namespacing `enum`" in `UIStoryboard` to a `struct` to avoid confusion with the inner enums
* The `UIStoryboard.Scene` enums now use `static func` instead of `static var` for the dedicated `ViewController` constructors ^(†)

^(†) _because it feels more explicit that calling a function like `UIStoryboard.Scene.Wizard.validatePasswordViewController()` will actually **instanciate** a new `ViewController`, rather than returning an existing one._

## 0.2.0

* Added `Segues` enums to `UIStoryboard` to be able to access their identifiers easily. ([@esttorhe](https://github.com/esttorhe), [#8](https://github.com/AliSoftware/SwiftGen/pull/8))
* Added this very `CHANGELOG.md`

## 0.1.0

Considered to be the first cleaned-up version, far from finished but really usable with clean code.

* Cleaner README
* Namespace the generated `enums` in an outer `enum` to avoid clobbering the `UIStoryboard` namespace

* 

## 0.0.3

* `swiftgen-storyboard` CLI

## 0.0.1
